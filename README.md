## AItrekker - Track tennis players and the ball

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10143385/140766555-b6819a06-0655-42d0-9b02-0ca188fc0fa3.mp4

The goal of this project is to

* to detect and track both tennis players, make a distinction between tennis players and non-tennis players.
* Detect and track the ball.
* Detect when the ball hits the ground and when it is at the highest point and when it is hit by a player.
* Visualize the movement of the tennis players and the ball in a topdown view

## Key files
* bird_eye_view.py: Class and functions to build a bird eye view animation
* trackNet/: Implementation of the neural network to detect the tennis ball
* curveFitting.py: polynomial curve fitting to detect when the ball is hit/ground
* generate_bird_eye_view.py: Generates the videos in topdown view
* object_tracker.py: Tracks the players and the ball

## Getting Started
To get started, install the proper dependencies either via Anaconda or Pip. I recommend Anaconda route for people using a GPU as it configures CUDA toolkit version for you.

### Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Tensorflow CPU
conda env create -f conda-cpu.yml
conda activate yolov4-cpu

# Tensorflow GPU
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
conda activate yolov4-gpu
```

### Pip
(TensorFlow 2 packages require a pip version >19.0.)
```bash
# TensorFlow CPU
pip install -r requirements.txt

# TensorFlow GPU
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
```
### Nvidia Driver (For GPU, if you are not using Conda Environment and haven't set up CUDA yet)
Make sure to use CUDA Toolkit version 10.1 as it is the proper version for the TensorFlow version used in this repository.

## Downloading Official YOLOv4 Pre-trained Weights
Our object tracker uses YOLOv4 to make the object detections, which deep sort then uses to track. There exists an official pre-trained YOLOv4 object detector model that is able to detect 80 classes. For easy demo purposes we will use the pre-trained weights for our tracker.
Download pre-trained yolov4.weights file: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cewMfusmPjYWbrnuJRuKhPMwRe_b9PaT

Copy and paste yolov4.weights from your downloads folder into the 'data' folder of this repository.

If you want to use yolov4-tiny.weights, a smaller model that is faster at running detections but less accurate, download file here: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4-tiny.weights

## Running the Tracker with YOLOv4
To implement the object tracking using YOLOv4, first we convert the .weights into the corresponding TensorFlow model which will be saved to a checkpoints folder. Then all we need to do is run the object_tracker.py script to run our object tracker with YOLOv4, DeepSort and TensorFlow.
```bash
# Convert darknet weights to tensorflow model
python save_model.py --model yolov4 

# Run yolov4 deep sort object tracker on video
python object_tracker.py --video ./data/video/test.mp4 --output ./outputs/demo.avi --model yolov4

# Run yolov4 deep sort object tracker on webcam (set video flag to 0)
python object_tracker.py --video 0 --output ./outputs/webcam.avi --model yolov4
```
The output flag allows you to save the resulting video of the object tracker running so that you can view it again later. Video will be saved to the path that you set. (outputs folder is where it will be if you run the above command!)

If you want to run yolov3 set the model flag to ``--model yolov3``, upload the yolov3.weights to the 'data' folder and adjust the weights flag in above commands. (see all the available command line flags and descriptions of them in a below section)

## Resulting Video
As mentioned above, the resulting video will save to wherever you set the ``--output`` command line flag path to. I always set it to save to the 'outputs' folder. You can also change the type of video saved by adjusting the ``--output_format`` flag, by default it is set to AVI codec which is XVID.
